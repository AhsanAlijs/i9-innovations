            In the intricate world of medical imaging, from the high-stakes performances of CT and MRI scans to the precise choreography of PET Scans and Cardiac Cathlabs, every participant faces unique challenges. Hospitals and diagnostic centers grapple with scheduling symphonies, while radiologists and technicians play a never-ending game of musical chairs with images and reports. Patients, on the other hand, often feel like they're lost in a maze, trying to find their way to their next appointment.

            Radiologists:
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Sifting through a mountain of images without efficient tools is like finding a needle in a haystack, in the dark.

            Did You Know?
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The first CT scan took several hours to complete the scan itself, and days to process the images. Today, we're whizzing through scans in minutes, thanks to technological advancements. Imagine the wait back then!

            MRI:
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Did you know that the first MRI exam on a human took place in 1977 and lasted almost five hours? Today,thanks to technological advancements, most MRI scans take just 30 to 60 minutes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-medium text-zinc-800">
            X-ray:
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            X-rays were discovered by accident in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. He won the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for this discovery, which revolutionized diagnostic medicine.

            Cardiac Cathlab:
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The first human cardiac catheterization, which involves threading a thin tube through a blood vessel to the heart, was daringly performed by Werner Forssmann on himself in 1929. This groundbreaking procedure laid the foundation for modern interventional cardiology.

            What is the difference between CT and MRI scans?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
            CT scans use X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of the body, ideal for diagnosing bone and joint issues. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves, better suited for soft tissues like the brain, spinal cord, and muscles.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-800">
            Is radiation from X-rays and CT scans safe?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
            While X-rays and CT scans involve exposure to radiation, the doses are typically low and the risk is considered small compared to the benefits of accurate diagnosis.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-800">
            How should I prepare for an MRI, CT, or X-ray?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Preparation can vary: MRI may require fasting and removal of metal objects, CT might need a contrast dye, and X-ray usually requires little to no special preparation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-800">
            Can I get an MRI if I have metal implants?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Inform your doctor of any metal implants, as some may be MRI-safe while others are not.
